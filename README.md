I made this cool tic tac toe that allows you to change the size of the playable board.
The game also has an opponent to play against. His name is Lionel and he is not very good.
In fact, he only picks random moves. Anyways beat him if you can.

HOW TO PLAY:

You're going to get asked a few questions from the console like whether your playing single or with a
friend, if alone what sign you want to play with, and finally the board size. Answer all of these with
a 1 or a 2 (I've got them numbered).

To make a move, put the row and column you want to place at. The indexing starts at one not zero so
just play like you normally would.

ANNECDOTES:

This was a fun challenge for sure. It took me about 3 days which really isn't all that fast. I spent a
lot of time figuring out the logic of the game surpisingly. I though the hard part would be printing the
hash marks. All of this was a valuable learning experience and I already feel quite a bit more capable
after completing it. If anyone ever plays this for themselves and finds a way to improve the code, Let me know!
I'm always looking to learn.
